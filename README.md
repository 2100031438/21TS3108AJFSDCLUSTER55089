A service management system is the coherent set of organizational resources that can be used to effectively and efficiently realize the goals of the service organization.
A good example of product service management at work is the Apple iPhone. It's an item that features small iterative changes every year, changing it slightly in terms of user experience, software, hardware and design in order to best fit what consumers want at the time of release.
Key responsibilities include: Administrating or architecting the technology components that enable the service. Acting as the technical escalation point for a service offering. Coordinating efforts, incidents, or resolving technical problems.
