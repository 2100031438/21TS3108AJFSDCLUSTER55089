A service management system is the coherent set of organizational resources that can be used to effectively and efficiently realize the goals of the service organization.
A good example of product service management at work is the Apple iPhone. It's an item that features small iterative changes every year, changing it slightly in terms of user experience, software, hardware and design in order to best fit what consumers want at the time of release.A service management system (SMS) is a set of processes, policies, and tools that help an organization deliver and manage its services. It provides a framework for planning, designing, delivering, monitoring, and optimizing services to meet the needs of customers.
An SMS can be used to manage any type of service, including IT services, customer service, and facilities management.
